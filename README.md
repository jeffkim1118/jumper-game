# Jumper Game

## Idea

It is a 2D platform jump game created with React. The goal of the game is get the most points by getting higher. The point can be gathered by simply jumping onto a platform safely. There will be many obstacles as the player goes up the map. Such as birds, planes, and any other objects. Players can use arrow keys on their keyboard and their spacebars to move the character.

## Current State

1. Currently it has initial background image, character, obstacle, and platform.
2. Player can move around using arrow key and space key on keyboard.

## Upcoming features

1. Character collision and physics (Gravity)
2. Moving obstacles. ( Example. Bird and plane will constantly move left and right to interrupt player to go up.
3. Score keeper ( Count up to 100 )
4. Checkpoint feature...? (Not sure about this one yet...)

# Installation

Make sure you have all the necessary files using:
```
  npm install
```

Start the program by typing in your console:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
